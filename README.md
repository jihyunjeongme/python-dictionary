* What containers are and their benefits
* How to find and run Docker containers from the Docker Hub
* How to create your first Docker container and understand the layering and union file system
* The best practices when developing Dockerfiles
* How to solve problems of orchestration: reconciliation, scaling, high availability, and service discovery
* Some of the tools that can help you run highly available applications in production, such as the IBM Container service -->

<!-- # Lab 1: Run your first container
[Youtube - Lab 1 Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=161&v=Mycr9j-jgYo)

## WHAT ARE CONTAINERS?

* A group of processes run in isolation
    - All processes MUST be able to run on the shared kernel

* Each container has its own set of "namespaces"(isolated view)
    - PID: process IDs
    - USER: user and group IDs
    - UTS: hostname and domain name
    - NS mount points
    - NET: Network devices, stacks, ports
    - IPC: inter-process communications, message queues

* cgroups - controls limits and monitoring of resources -->
